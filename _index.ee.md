## Welcome to Neon! 

In this workshop you will learn how to accelerate development in RDS by creating ephemeral environments in Neon Postgres.

- We'll show you how to speed up your development process by integrating **Neon** with your existing **AWS RDS Postgres** setup. If you don't have an existing RDS Postgres setup, we'll walk you through how to set one up and migrate your staging data to Neon.
- While RDS is great for production, it has limitations when it comes to development. Neon, a serverless Postgres solution with features like **database branching**, provides a more flexible and developer-friendly environment for testing and development. With Neon, you can improve your workflows and collaboration without making disruptive changes to your production database.
