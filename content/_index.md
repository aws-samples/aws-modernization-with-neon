![Neon Logo](/images/neon-logo.png)

### Welcome!

In this workshop, you will learn how to enhance your development workflow by integrating Neon alongside your existing Amazon RDS Postgres setup. We will explore how to leverage Neon's serverless PostgreSQL solution and database branching capabilities to optimize your development and testing processes while maintaining your production infrastructure on RDS.

RDS provides a robust and reliable foundation for production environments. By combining it with Neon's innovative features, you can create a more efficient and flexible development pipeline.

### Learning Objectives
- Implement Neon as a complementary development environment to RDS
- Streamline data synchronization between RDS and Neon using pg_dump and GitHub Actions
- Efficiently manage changes across both environments
- Accelerate iteration cycles and enhance team collaboration
- Optimize resource utilization in development while maintaining consistency with production

## Who should take this workshop?
- Developers
- Database Administrators
- DevOps Engineers
- Solutions Architects
- Anyone interested in optimizing their PostgreSQL development workflow

## Cost
This workshop will incur costs associated with using Amazon RDS and Neon. It's important to be aware that once the lab is completed, we highly advise following the instructions to delete any resources to avoid additional costs. TODO[Click here](#) to navigate to the Clean-Up instructions.
