## Welcome

In this dynamic 120-minute workshop, discover how to supercharge your development speed by seamlessly integrating Neon with your existing AWS RDS Postgres setup.

While RDS remains the go-to choice for production environments, it often falls short in providing an optimal development experience. Enter Neon: a cutting-edge serverless PostgreSQL solution that offers powerful database branching capabilities. Neon provides a developer-friendly alternative for your development and testing environments, enabling you to enhance workflows and team collaboration without disrupting your production setup.

What you'll learn:

1. Setting up Neon as your agile development environment
2. Automating data transfer from RDS to Neon using pg_dump and GitHub Actions
3. Efficiently migrating changes back to RDS

Our step-by-step guide will walk you through each process, ensuring you're equipped to:

• Iterate faster
• Collaborate more effectively
• Reduce development costs
• Maintain a stable production database on RDS

By the end of this workshop, you'll have the knowledge and tools to significantly improve your PostgreSQL development workflow, bridging the gap between RDS stability and Neon's flexibility.
