![Neon Logo](/images/neon-logo.png)

## Welcome

Discover how to enhance your development workflow by integrating Neon alongside your existing AWS RDS Postgres setup.

RDS provides a robust and reliable foundation for production environments. Now, with Neon's innovative serverless PostgreSQL solution and powerful database branching capabilities, you can further optimize your development and testing processes. Learn how to leverage both technologies to create a more efficient, flexible development pipeline without altering your production infrastructure.

What you'll learn:

1. Implementing Neon as a complementary development environment
2. Streamlining data synchronization between RDS and Neon using pg_dump and GitHub Actions
3. Efficiently managing changes across both environments

Our step-by-step guide will walk you through each process, enabling you to:

• Accelerate iteration cycles
• Enhance team collaboration
• Optimize resource utilization in development
• Maintain consistency between development and production environments

By the end of this workshop, you'll have the knowledge and tools to create a seamless workflow that combines the strengths of both RDS and Neon, elevating your PostgreSQL development experience.

Join us to explore how RDS and Neon can work together to supercharge your database development process!
