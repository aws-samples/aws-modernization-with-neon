# Creating Your GitHub Repository

In this section, we'll create the GitHub repository that will host our database synchronization workflow.

## ðŸš€ Creating a New Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/new) and sign in

3. Configure your repository:
   - Enter a repository name (e.g., `neon`)
   - Choose "Public" or "Private"
   - Initialize with a README
   - Click "Create repository"

## âœ… Verification

Make sure:
1. Your repository is created
2. Note your repository name - you'll need it for the OIDC setup

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

Now that your repository is created, we'll set up OIDC authentication with AWS.
